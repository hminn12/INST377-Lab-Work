<h1>HAIN MINN Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
<h2>First, the basics.</h2>
<p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>
<p>You should list your top 5 albums below.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Album 1</li>
    <li>Album 2</li>
    <li>Album 3</li>
    <li>Album 4</li>
    <li>Album 5</li>
</ol>
<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>


<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>


<p>Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.
<br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
<br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
<br>
<img src='./images/mochi.jpg' alt='JPG'/>
<img src='./images/mochi.gif' alt='GIF'/>
<img src='./images/mochi.png' alt='PNG'/>
<img src='./images/mochi.svg' alt='SVG'/>
